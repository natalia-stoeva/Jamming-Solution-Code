## Overview
This is a solution to the first part of the [Jamming Project](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/full-stack-engineer/paths/fscj-22-front-end-development/tracks/fscj-22-react-part-ii/modules/wdcp-22-jammming-54dd6aa4-39da-42be-989f-67a12f65b1a8/projects/jammming-prj) from Codecademy.

## Project Goals
Create a Playlist App With the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
* The user can search for an artist in the SearchBar
* When pressing the Search button an access token is obtained from the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) using the [Implicit Grant Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/implicit-grant/)
* The user is redirected to The Spotify Accounts service. If the user is not logged in, they are prompted to do so using their Spotify credentials
* Finally, the user is redirected back to the Jamming app
* The user can add and remove songs to a custom playlist
* Then they can save the playlist to their Spotify account 

## Tech stack
* React v: 18.2.0
